Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am a PhD student at the [Data Science Group *PaDS* in Passau](https://www.fim.uni-passau.de/en/data-science/) under the supervision of Michael Granitzer.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on analyses of deep structures of neural networks and automated machine learning
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning to control latent spaces in deep learning models and reliable statistical hypothesis testing
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on automl + graph embeddings + explainable AI

**Some Projects:**
- [deepstruct](https://github.com/innvariant/deepstruct) - fusing deep learning and graph theory for analysis of structures in neural networks
- [deepgg](https://github.com/innvariant/deepgg) - experiments and results on a Deep Graph Generator for learning latent vector spaces of graphs
- [eddy](https://github.com/innvariant/eddy) - artificial optimization landscapes and several search methods to learn on optimization techniques
